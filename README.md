Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive tumor subtype with a high risk of recurrence, metastasis, chemotherapy resistance, and acquired capacity to survive and grow under nutrient-deprived and hypoxic conditions. Under hypoxic conditions, TNBC cells can grow, survive, induce metabolic reprogramming and apoptosis and alter cell adhesion and motility to facilitate metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy. The project aims to identify what cellular organization genes are upregulated by tumor cells in hypoxic and/or mTOR inhibited environments and if they are a part of the same pathways.
